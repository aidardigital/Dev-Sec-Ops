Input Output and Redirection Theory

# What is File Descriptor?
In Unix and related computer operating systems, a file descriptor (FD) is an abstract indicator used to access a file or other input/output resource, such as a pipe or network socket. File descriptors form part of the POSIX application programming interface.

# Input/Output Types
I/O Name Abbreviation File Descriptor

Standard Input stdin 0

Standard Output stdout 1

Standard Error stderr 2

# Redirection
> - Redirects standard output to a file (Overwrite existing content)

>> - Redirects standard output to a file (Append to any existing content)

< - Redirects input from a file to a command

# Example:
ls -l > file.txt - this will put Output of ls command to file.txt (with overwriting)
2 > /dev/null - this will put any error happens to the null place
sort < file.txt - this will take the input from the file.txt for the sort command
