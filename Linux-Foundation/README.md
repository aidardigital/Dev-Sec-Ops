# Important Notes
- Use approach is like this: Read Theory -> Practice Hands-On -> Do Read Theory
- You already should have Linux Installed (WSL, VM, Live USB, Dual Boot, Cloud)
- Usually used Ubuntu to practice with instructor, but can be used other distro

- What is Linux Distributions ?
- Unix Architecture

# History of Unix
- The history of Unix dates back to the mid-1960s when the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, AT&T Bell Labs, and General Electric were jointly developing an experimental time-sharing operating system called Multics for the GE-645 mainframe.Multics introduced many innovations, but had many problems.
- Bell Labs, frustrated by the size and complexity of Multics but not the aims, slowly pulled out of the project. Their last researchers to leave Multics – Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Doug McIlroy, and Joe Ossanna among others – decided to redo the work on a much smaller scale. In 1979, Dennis Ritchie described their vision for Unix.

# Linux vs Unix
- Linux is an operating system which is developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991. The name “Linux” originates from the Linux kernel. It is open-source and free to use the operating system. It is used for computer hardware and software, game development, mainframes, etc. It can run various client programs.
- Unix is a portable, multi-tasking, a multi-user operating system developed by AT&T. It started as a one-man venture under the initiative of Ken Thompson of Bell Labs. It proceeded to turn out to become the most widely used operating systems. It is used in web servers, workstations, and PCs. Many business applications are accessible in it.

# GNU Linux
- Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run.
- GNU is responsible for the utilities , Shell and more ... linux = GNU + Linus Torvald's Kernel
- I recommend you to read more from the official Docs (3 Minutes Read): Linux and the GNU System

# Linux Distributions
- A Linux distribution (often abbreviated as distro) is an operating system made from a software collection that is based upon the Linux kernel and, often, a package management system.
- Linux users usually obtain their operating system by downloading one of the Linux distributions, which are available for a wide variety of systems ranging from embedded devices and personal computers to powerful supercomputers .
- Examples for Linux distribution: Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Arch Linux, Fedora, Kali Linux, SUSE Linux, Alpine Linux, Red Hat, Debian

# Unix Architecture
- Kernel − The kernel is the heart of the operating system. It interacts with the hardware and most of the tasks like memory management, task scheduling and file management.
- Shell − The shell is the utility that processes your requests. When you type in a command at your terminal, the shell interprets the command and calls the program that you want. The shell uses standard syntax for all commands. C Shell, Bourne Shell and Korn Shell are the most famous shells which are available with most of the Unix variants.
- Commands and Utilities − There are various commands and utilities which you can make use of in your day to day activities. cp, mv, cat and grep, etc. are few examples of commands and utilities. There are over 250 standard commands plus numerous others provided through 3rd party software. All the commands come along with various options.
- Files and Directories − All the data of Unix is organized into files. All files are then organized into directories. These directories are further organized into a tree-like structure called the filesystem.
