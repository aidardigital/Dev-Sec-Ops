# **About This Repo**
Examples of Development Security Operations (DevSecOps), e.g., vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, threat analysis, tools, techniques.

# **Introduction**

**DevOps** is a combination of software development and information technology operations that enables businesses to deliver applications at a faster pace. It brings together development and operations teams so there are fewer redundancies in the software development process.

**DevSecOps** is a culture shift in the software industry that aims to bake security into the rapid-release cycles that are typical of modern application development and deployment.
