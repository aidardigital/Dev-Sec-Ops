# **Introduction**

Vulnerability scanning is the process of identifying security weaknesses and flaws in systems and software running on them. A vulnerability scan assesses security vulnerabilities in computers, internal and external networks, and communications equipment that cyber criminals can exploit. It is an automated activity that scans infrastructure targets such as IP addresses, server ports etc. for known vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
