# The 5 Phases of Ethical Hacking (by EC-Council, edited)

# 1. Reconnaissance
Reconnaissance helps identify which attacks can be launched and how likely the organization’s systems fall vulnerable to those attacks.

Footprinting collects data from areas such as:
- TCP and UDP services
- Vulnerabilities
- Through specific IP addresses
- Host of a network

In ethical hacking, footprinting is of two types:
- **Active:** This method involves gathering information from the target directly using Nmap tools to scan the target’s network, servers etc.
- **Passive:** This method is collecting information without directly accessing the target, e.g., social media accounts, public websites etc.

# 2. Scanning
The second step in the hacking methodology is scanning, where attackers try to find different ways to gain the target’s information. The attacker looks for information such as user accounts, credentials, IP addresses, etc. Tools such as dialers, port scanners, network mappers, sweepers, and vulnerability scanners are used in.

- **Vulnerability Scanning:** This practice targets the vulnerabilities of a target to exploit those weaknesses.
- **Port Scanning:** This involves TCP/UDP port scanning to find open doors to access an organization’s systems.
- **Network Scanning:** This practice is used to detect active devices on a network and find ways to exploit it.

# 3. Gaining Access
The next step in hacking is where an attacker uses all means to get unauthorized access to the target’s systems, applications, or networks. An attacker can use various tools and methods to gain access and enter a system. This hacking phase attempts to get into the system and exploit the system by downloading malicious software etc. 

Ethical hackers and penetration testers can secure potential entry points, ensure all systems and applications are password-protected, and secure the client's network infrastructure using a firewall. They can send fake social engineering emails to the employees and identify which employee is likely to fall victim to cyberattacks.

# 4. Maintaining Access
Once the attacker manages to access the target’s system, they try their best to maintain that access. In this stage, the hacker continuously exploits the system, run DDoS attacks, uses the hijacked system as a launching pad, or steals the entire database. A backdoor and Trojan are tools used to exploit a vulnerable system e.g., steal credentials. In this phase, the attacker aims to maintain their unauthorized access until they complete their malicious activities without the user finding out.

Ethical hackers or penetration testers utilize this phase to get hold of malicious activities and find their root cause to avoid the systems from being exploited.

# 5. Clearing Track
The last phase of ethical hacking requires hackers to clear their track as no attacker wants to get caught. This step ensures that the attackers leave no clues or evidence behind that could be traced back. It is crucial as ethical hackers need to maintain their connection in the system without getting identified by incident response or the forensics team. It includes editing, corrupting, or deleting logs or registry values. The attacker also deletes or uninstalls folders, applications.

In ethical hacking, ethical hackers can use the following ways to erase their tracks:
- Using reverse HTTP Shells
- Deleting cache and history to erase the digital footprint
- Using ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) Tunnels

These are the five steps of the CEH hacking methodology that ethical hackers or penetration testers can use to detect and identify vulnerabilities, find potential open doors for cyberattacks and mitigate security breaches to secure the organizations. The Certified Ethical Hacking (CEH v11) provided by EC-Council trains an individual.
