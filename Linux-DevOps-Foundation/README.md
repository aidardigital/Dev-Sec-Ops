# Important Notes
- Use approach is like this : Read Theory -> Practice with the Hands-On -> Read theory again
- You already should have Linux Installed (WSL, VM, Live USB, Dual Boot, Cloud)
- Usually used Ubuntu to practice with instructor, but can be used other distro

Note: to be able to practice with me any Linux Distribution will do the job, no worries

# History of Unix
- The history of Unix dates back to the mid-1960s when the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, AT&T Bell Labs, and General Electric were jointly developing an experimental time-sharing operating system called Multics for the GE-645 mainframe.Multics introduced many innovations, but had many problems.
- Bell Labs, frustrated by the size and complexity of Multics but not the aims, slowly pulled out of the project. Their last researchers to leave Multics – Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Doug McIlroy, and Joe Ossanna among others – decided to redo the work on a much smaller scale. In 1979, Dennis Ritchie described their vision for Unix.

# Linux vs Unix

# GNU Linux
- Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run.
- GNU is responsible for the utilities , Shell and more ... linux = GNU + Linus Torvald's Kernel
- I recommend you to read more from the official Docs (3 Minutes Read): Linux and the GNU System

# Linux Distributions
- A Linux distribution (often abbreviated as distro) is an operating system made from a software collection that is based upon the Linux kernel and, often, a package management system.
- Linux users usually obtain their operating system by downloading one of the Linux distributions, which are available for a wide variety of systems ranging from embedded devices and personal computers to powerful supercomputers .

Examples for Linux distribution :
- Ubuntu
- Linux Mint
- Arch Linux
- Fedora
- Deepin
- Kubuntu
- SUSE Linux
- Alpine Linux
- Red Hat
- Debian
