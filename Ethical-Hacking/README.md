**IMPORTANT NOTE !!! This Section is intended for the DevOps / Cyber Security / Ethical Hacking Field**

 All the needed for you as a Hacker, Pentester or Cyber Security Engineer, but not for Web Development.

**Section Outline**
- Quick Brief Introduction about Ethical Hacking and Python
- Learn Python From the Scratch Step-By-Step as Ethical Hacker
- Start Building Ethical Hacking Tools From the Scratch as well

**What Is Ethical Hacking?**

Ethical Hacking, also known as penetration testing or pen testing, is legally breaking into computers and devices to test an organization's defenses. You are literally getting paid to keep up with the latest technology and get to break into company managed computers without the threat of being arrested. Companies engage ethical hackers to identify vulnerabilities in their systems. If you hack the current defenses, you’ve given the client a chance to close the hole before an attacker discovers it. If you don’t find anything, your client is even happier because they now get to declare their systems secure enough that even paid hackers couldn’t break into it.

**What is Python and why to use it in Security?**

Python is one of the versatile programming language, created by Guido van Rossum between 1985- 1990. An interpreted language, Python has a design that focuses on code readability and allows programmers to write code in fewer lines as compared to others like Java and C++.

**Why Python is still a preferred choice among cyber security professionals?**
- Easy to learn
- Easy debugging
- Wide use
- Object-oriented language
- Open-source language
- High-performance
- Extensive support libraries
- Improved programmer’s productivity
- User-friendly data structures
- Productivity and Speed

**Conclusion:**

A lot of the reasons mentioned above and several others make programmers prefer Python over any other programming language. Using Python by cyber security professionals over any other programming language is also common due to factors such as better respond time, user-friendly data structure and security.
